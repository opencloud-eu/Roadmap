        ## Advanced search
        The advanced search makes it easier to find files even when you don‚Äôt remember the exact name or location.
        - **OCR** (Optical Character Recognition): Find scanned documents and images by searching their text.
        - **Full-Text Search**: Locate files by searching within their content.
        - **Tags**: Retrieve files based on assigned keywords.
        - **Filter** by File Type, Modified Date, and Location Filters: Narrow down results when details are unclear.
        - **Filename-Only** Search: Quickly find files when you know the name.

        These advanced search features reduce time spent searching by allowing you to refine results step by step, helping you locate the right file even with limited information.
